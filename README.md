# this project is INCREDIBLY SCUFFED and olibomby probably will patches this kind of thing in his mapping tools within 1 second of dev time but whatever i do not care i do this for the educational purposes :halgohstare:

### reminder for you
* colorburst is not finished, the part where it calculates the slider length is WIP
* the code is a spaghetti for sure so any good developers out there *PLEASE* roast my code in the issues tab u can call me yandev whatever
* if u wanna make a custom script (cus there are only 3 script with 1 wip LOL) then u can download python and download the source code instead
  * and everything kinda just works on 
  ``` 
  if the objects kinda match the conditions then run the default colorhax command for this
  ```


# how to use
1. create a text file
2. the language is pretty simple tbh its kinda like
```
osufile=[path_to_your_osu_file]

[scriptname]=[parameters (naturally separated with,)]
```
3. for the starttime and endtime leave the parameters with "-" and the default value will be the start/end of the map
4. for the colorhax pattern, indefault it will be separate with "/" e,g, "1/8/3" (for the funny using the same color in the section works somehow LOL)

---

**the default paremeters are**
1. Colorhax `colorhax=[starttime],[endtime],[colorhax pattern]`
2. Colorburst `colorburst=[starttime],[endtime],[colorhax pattern],[beatsnap (e.g. 6 | using 1/6 will encounter errors.)]`
3. Bookmarkhax `colorhax=[colorhax pattern]`
